# dota2-post-match-bot
Bot that gathers latest Dota 2 pro matches and reports on the results as a post-match discussion thread to /r/dota2 written in Python. 

If you have a question, you can either raise a tagged issue or message /u/d2-match-bot-speaks on Reddit. If it's pressing, I recommend raising an issue as I do not frequently check the Reddit account.
